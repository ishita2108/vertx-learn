Notes

vertx object - In Vert.x, the Vertx object is the central component of the framework, acting as the entry point for most of its functionality.
It represents the core runtime environment and is responsible for managing:

Event Loop: The Vertx instance creates and manages event loops, which are the foundation of Vert.x's non-blocking, reactive programming model.

Verticles: It deploys and manages verticles, which are units of execution in a Vert.x application.

Shared Resources: Provides APIs to access shared resources like event buses, file systems, and timers.

In Vert.x, a verticle is the fundamental execution unit. It's similar to a thread or a process in traditional programming models
but is designed for the event-driven and non-blocking architecture of Vert.x.

A verticle encapsulates the logic of your application, such as handling HTTP requests, processing data, or interacting with external systems.
It runs within the context of a Vertx instance and is managed by the Vert.x runtime.

Key Features of Verticles
Asynchronous and Non-Blocking:

Verticles operate using an event loop, ensuring they do not block threads.
They can process events (like incoming messages or timers) asynchronously.
Isolation:
Each verticle is isolated, meaning different verticles can run independently.

Event Bus Communication:
Verticles communicate with each other via the event bus, which supports point-to-point, publish-subscribe, and request-reply messaging.

Lifecycle Management:
Vert.x manages the lifecycle of verticles, including deployment, undeployment, and failure handling.

In Vert.x, Event Loops are a crucial part of its concurrency model, handling asynchronous tasks in a non-blocking manner.
Vert.x operates in a single-threaded, event-driven model where event loops are responsible for processing events and executing tasks in a non-blocking way.
Here's a detailed explanation:

1. What is an Event Loop in Vert.x?
An Event Loop in Vert.x is a thread responsible for executing tasks and handling events.
Vert.x uses event loops to process non-blocking operations asynchronously.
The event loop is a fundamental part of the Vert.x concurrency model, enabling the system to handle thousands of concurrent operations with a small number of threads.

2. How Does Vert.x Use Event Loops?
Vert.x uses a single-threaded event loop per core by default, which can handle multiple
tasks concurrently using non-blocking I/O. When an event (e.g., a network request) occurs, the event loop picks it up and processes it asynchronously.

Vert.x provides Worker Verticles for tasks that need to block (e.g., database access) because blocking operations shouldn't be executed in the event loop.
If blocking tasks are handled in the event loop, it can cause delays and hinder the overall performance of the system.

3. Event Loop and Verticles
Verticles are the units of deployment in Vert.x. A Verticle can be deployed on the event loop thread to process asynchronous tasks.
Worker Verticles are a special kind of Verticle designed to handle blocking code. They run on worker threads, ensuring that the event loop is not blocked.

4. Event Loop Model in Vert.x
Vert.x provides a small set of event loops that handle asynchronous events.
The event loops are executed on a fixed pool of threads. Each core in the machine runs its own event loop.
Each event loop can handle tasks such as HTTP requests, messages from other Verticles, and other events.

The Event Bus in Vert.x is a lightweight, high-performance messaging system that enables communication between different components of a
 Vert.x application, such as Verticles, and even between separate Vert.x instances. It supports publish/subscribe, point-to-point, and request/response
 messaging patterns.

Key Features of the Event Bus
Asynchronous Communication: Enables non-blocking message passing between Verticles.
Clustered or Local: Can work within a single JVM or across a cluster of Vert.x instances.
Dynamic Routing: Messages are dynamically routed based on addresses.
Built-in Protocols: Works with JSON objects, strings, and binary buffers out of the box.
Extensibility: Supports custom codecs for other message types.

Messaging Patterns Supported by Event Bus
Point-to-Point Messaging:

A message sent to an address is consumed by one handler.
Use send() for point-to-point communication.
Publish/Subscribe Messaging:

A message sent to an address is consumed by all handlers registered on that address.
Use publish() for publish/subscribe communication.
Request/Response Messaging:

A sender can expect a reply from the receiver.
Use send() with a reply handler for request/response communication.

In Vert.x, a Codec is a mechanism for encoding and decoding objects that are sent over the Event Bus. It allows you to
define how custom objects are serialized and deserialized when they are transmitted between different parts of your application.

Why Use a Codec?
The Event Bus can send basic types (e.g., String, Integer, JsonObject) by default.
To send custom objects, Vert.x requires a way to serialize and deserialize them.
A Codec defines how these custom objects are transformed into a transferable format (e.g., JSON or binary) and reconstructed on the receiving side.

Future: Represents the result of an asynchronous operation that might not yet be completed. It can be succeeded or failed.
Promise: A writable counterpart to a Future. It allows you to signal the success or failure of the asynchronous operation.

future can react on the outcome of promise

promise == write view     future == read view
